        // operations, given that sorting is unnecessary and less efficient in this context, and also,
        // the items on the right of the pivot are in decreasing order, so reversing the rightmost 
        // items is guaranteed to be correct and replacing one of the decreasing value doesnâ€™t affect the order.
